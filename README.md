## Class Project 1 - Electric Power Consumption


For Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis Course

By Casey Tsui

This analysis reads in data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, cleans the code, and then produces four separate plots based on an assignment to recreate those plots. Each R script file produces the png file of the same name.

The coding files read the data set in full and then subset the data to include only observations collected on two dates. This was done rather than reading the data from just those dates. I look forward to learning about these pre-read subsetting methods.
